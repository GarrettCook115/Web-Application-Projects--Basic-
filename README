# Basic Tkinter implemented python web appplications regarding windows and various OS command prompt executables. 

# FlaskApp1.html Allows for the FlaskApp.py file to execute on a web browser at the given 127.0.0.1 loopback address.
# FlaskApp.py uses the Flask framework for simplistic web development features and interoperability between Linux and Windows OSes. 

# WndCmds.py is a basic (The First) implementation of this self made project. Firstly learning what different python libraries like Tkinter did, adn later creating small labels, 
# buttons and subprocess connected inorder to make this simplistic application. Tkinter is a python library useful for small, simplistic widget creation with smalelr apps such as this. 

#TkinterApp1.py is a cleaner variant of the WndCmds.py with more options and OS command selections besides Windows. 
# It also implements a few run command selections such as Perfmonane monitoring, Windows verison and Event log viewer. "Based on what OS it's running on."
